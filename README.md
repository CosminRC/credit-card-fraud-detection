# \# Credit Card Fraud Detection

# 

# \## Project Overview

# This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques.

# 

# \## Dataset

# \- Real-world anonymized credit card transactions

# \- Highly imbalanced dataset (fraud < 1%)

# 

# \## Models Used

# \- Logistic Regression

# \- Random Forest

# \- XGBoost (final model)

# 

# \## Techniques

# \- Data preprocessing and scaling

# \- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# \- SMOTE for class imbalance

# \- Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, and F1-score

# 

# \## Inference

# The final model is used to predict fraud probability on new (simulated) transactions.

# 

# \## Future Improvements

# \- Threshold tuning

# \- Neural networks

# \- UI integration for real-time predictions
